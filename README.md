# expo-starter
Basic expo starter pack with useful packs loaded 
This is just a starter template with preloaded packs to jumpstart custom expo dev. 
This will be updated over time and hopefully it would be useful for anyone that wants to clone it and do a onetime install of all the packages included for offline tinkering, practicing & prototyping.

Will update over time.
